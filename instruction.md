All participants in a Zoom webinar are divided into three roles by the platform: panelists, attendees and host. This is a terminology created by Zoom.

* Panelists: all conference presenters and organizers.
  * Can share their webcam and speak at any moment.
  * Can type answers to any question submitted by attendees in Q&A field.
  * Conference presenters can also request promoting their co-authors to panelists.
* Attendees: anyone else.
  * Can only submit questions in the Q&A field and participate in the chat.
  * Cannot share their screen and can only speak if allowed by moderator.
* Host: the role of host will be taken by the moderator of the active session.
  * The host has all the privileges of panelists but can also mute or kick out any participant.
  * A host can also nominate a co-host, who has the same rights.

We will also use the following terminology for this document:

* Active presenter: the person whose paper is been presented at a given moment.
* Session participants: all people whose papers are part of the active session.
* Moderator: one of the organizers, who will be assigned to run each session.
