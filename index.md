## About
The UBC-HKU Summer Theory Conference is an annual event that alternates between Vancouver (University of British Columbia) and Hong Kong (University of Hong Kong). For more information about the past editions, please visit [here](http://www.sef.hku.hk/~wsuen/research.html). This year, the conference was supposed to be held in Vancouver, but due to the pandemic of COVID-19, we decided to make it as an online conference.


## Date
July 21st - 22nd, 2020 (in PDT).

## Venue

The UBC-HKU Summer Theory Conference 2020 is going **virtual**. We plan to have it as a **Zoom webinar**, and anyone can join the conference as "participants."

## Instruction

Instruction is available [here](https://ubcmicroworkshop.github.io/ubc-hku-2020/instruction).

## Call for Panelists

Although the UBC-HKU Summer Theory Conference 2020 is open to the public, we limit the number of "**panelists**" who can turn on their webcam and microphone, because we would like to make sure that (i) the conference will not be disturbed by an attacker, and (ii) interruptions are not too frequent.

Having said that, we would like to promote active discussions, and to achieve this, we plan to invite **outside panelists**. Some panelists are recruited by an open call. The panelists are not required to prepare anything. What we only expect panelists is, (i) to agree with the video recording for a limited purpose (we will share the video with our HKU colleagues) and (ii) to actively participate in the Q&A/Discussion time.

If you are interested, please submit your application via the following Google form:

If you have any questions, please take a contact with Shunya Noda (shunya.noda@ubc.ca).
